# calculator
This is a simple calculator webpage made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

Features:
  * Buttons are laid out in a container using flexbox.
  * There is a display for an operand that is input as well as for results from calculations.
  * Evaluates no more than a single pair of numbers at a time.
  * Operations available for use are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  * Operator buttons are slightly darkened while in use.
  * Results are rounded to the nearest thousandth place when dealing with fractions.
  * Exponential notation used for calculations resulting in large numbers.
  * There is a clear button (AC) to reset the calculator.
  * No dividing by zero!
  * Allows the result from a calculation, evaluated using the equals button, to be used as an operand for the next calculation. 
  * Decimal button to use while inputting an operand. It is disabled if in use, to prevent more than one decimal in an operand.
  * Backspace button to delete last character (number or decimal) for when inputting an operand.
  * Keyboard support (the clear button is mapped to the 'c' key).
  * Makes use of CSS data attributes (user-defined) to uniquely map buttons to their corresponding key values.
